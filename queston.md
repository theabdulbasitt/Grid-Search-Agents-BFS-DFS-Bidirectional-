Implement this project from scratch on the best language you know: best is Python to practice for interviews. 

Time 2 days. 

- Given a NxN Grid in which agent can either move 1 point down or 1 point right in one move at a time. There can be some blockers in the grid represented by 1. A 0 in the grid means you can move to that cell, 1 means you cannot. 
- Implement a path finding agent using each search algorithm: BFS, DFS, Bidirectional and Djikstra
- Display the agent path using Matplotlib in Python or some other UI library.
